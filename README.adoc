This version of react-popover is forked from MrBlenny/react-popover, which is in turn forked from littlebits/react-popover.

MrBlenny/react-popover was modified to support `redux` and `react-router`, but contained JSX and required alternate build directions than other included repos.

This version is compiled.

This repo is no longer necessary as littlebits has addressed the issue in the main branch now (see https://github.com/littlebits/react-popover/issues/77 for details about the issue and fix).
